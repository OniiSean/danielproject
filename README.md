# Daniel Ming – Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website I built for my friend **Daniel Ming** as a commission for my web development class project. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and responsive single-page site that Daniel can use to showcase his background, projects, and contact info.

The site is built with **React** and **Vite**, and styled with custom **CSS** (no UI frameworks) to keep it lightweight and fully customizable.

## ✨ Features

- **Hero section** with Daniel’s name, roles, and call-to-scroll
- **About section** with a short bio and background summary  
- **Projects section** with cards for a few highlighted projects  
- **Contact section** with an easy way to get in touch  
- **Responsive layout** – works on desktop and mobile  
- Warm, modern color palette and subtle animations

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Styling:** Plain CSS (custom layout, animations, and theming)
- **Package manager:** npm
- **Deployment:** Vercel

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
